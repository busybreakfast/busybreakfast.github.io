I have been a graphic design student for almost 5 months. If you going to study design there will be a lot of ups and down, but hopefully at the end you will find yourself willing to continue that journey!

Along the way you face joy, pressure, Google, success, pride, failure, happiness sadness and etc. Oh, yeah, and moments of frustration, when you start your 5th chocolate bar and continue scrolling, scrolling, scrolling looking for some specific details. After surviving several nights like that (plus you start predicting when it’s time to renew your coffee and chocolate supplies) life get’s easier. Still all 5 months were totally worth it and taught me a lot.

### It’s all about time-managment
Live like a german — try to plan everything what you can. It’s very easy to say, but very hard to do. Life get’s much easier, when you get settled with some schedule.

I can’t design from 9 till 5 and then go home. Nobody can. My usual time for it is somewhere after 18:00 (6 PM) and far beyond 3:00 in the morning. Moreover, if I don’t feel like designing all attempts will not bring an excellent result. In moments like this it’s the best time to do laundry, go to pay for a flat or just renew chocolate supplies.

### Do great right from the first day
Showing that you trying hard actually save you at the end of the semester. In two ways: teachers are more willing to help you (throw all schools actually) and you end up with less work at the end then you classmates screaming and cursing all subjects.
It’s about how you feel the design (personal style) For me it should be reasonable (!), understandable and clean. For my classmate is all about pattern and crazy unpredictable solutions, for another dude it’s about black and white, geometry and minimalism. From the first day I was seeking for what drives me, what I like to do in the design field.

### It’s not about the tools. It’s about the approach and goals
Funny, but artist is not a person with a brush and canvas, but a person with idea and it’s realisation. Even knowing only how to use pen tool or brush in Photoshop it’s still possible to come up with something creative. All what you need is in your head. Tools only limit the variety of styles you can work with.

### If you feel like stealing something — do it smart
“Em, stealing, no I will not do that, Yuriy. No way” — you may say. Ok, but when you really stuck sometimes it’s better to steal an idea (or some part of a design) and use it to pass the subject. At the end of the day I can’t solve all the problems. Well, you may stay moral, but you loose.

And by stealing I mean, that you might see an interesting idea (origami swans made of money, for instance). But you working on a project, which is about swans, but not about money at all. Nice idea, but why not to try use some different materials for your origami? And at the end of the day you not really stealing.

Erik Spiekermann gave a very nice advice:
> “If I can’t afford a font for the project (low client’s budget) I study that font, I draw that font by hand, I spend the whole day learning and researching that font. Then the next day I sit and create the same font by memory. Result — always a new unique font.”

### Ask, ask, ask
First of all ask for feedback. Ask everybody, all teachers, classmates, friends (but not mom. She love’s you and might say — oh, dear it’s lovely.) You share you work and immediately see how people react. I usually ask a simple question: “What do you see?” This will give an idea how you design works and how other understands it. Still mind you target audience. If it’s a visuals for rocket science task don’t demand from school kids to answer correctly.

### Travel, when you can
Travel a lot. Even it’s a nearest soup restaurants, check it out. In my case I went to Germany. I usually get kicks when I see signs and nice arrows and Munich metro was a treasure chest for me. So travel and see how others solved problems. Maybe it will help you one day.

### Have fun and make friends with people, who can level you up
Without fun it’s pain to study. So if the 5-th lesson in a row you feel bored it’s time to change attitude. Maybe be a little bit crazy, add some colour, create a sculpture or add your other hobby.

And make connections. It’s not individuals who push the projects, solves tasks or create brilliant things. It’s small armies of creative, not lazy people. You need one to go on.
